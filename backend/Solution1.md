# API Stats Endpoint Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Asynchronous File Operations
- **Previous**: Used synchronous `fs.readFile` with callbacks, which is less modern and harder to manage.
- **Updated**: Adopted `fs.promises` with `async/await` for `readFile`, specifying `utf8` encoding.
- **what is the value here**: Non-blocking I/O improves performance, and `async/await` simplifies error handling and code structure.
- **Implementation**: Refactored file reading in `loadStats` to use `fs.promises.readFile`.

### 2. Data Validation
- **Previous**: No validation of parsed JSON data, risking errors from malformed data.
- **Updated**: Validates that the data is an array in `loadStats`, throwing an error if not.
- **what is the value here**: Ensures robustness by preventing runtime errors from invalid data formats.
- **Implementation**: Added array validation in `loadStats` with a clear error message.

### 3. Caching Mechanism
- **Previous**: Calculated stats (`total` and `averagePrice`) on every request, causing redundant file reads and CPU-intensive operations.
- **Updated**: Introduced `statsCache` to store `total`, `averagePrice`, and `timestamp`, serving cached results unless the data file changes.
- **what is the value here**: Reduces file I/O and CPU usage, improving response times for frequent requests.
- **Implementation**: Created `loadStats` to compute and cache stats, used in the GET handler.

### 4. File Watching for Cache Updates
- **Previous**: No mechanism to detect data file changes, requiring manual updates.
- **Updated**: Uses `fs.watch` to monitor `DATA_PATH`, triggering `loadStats` on file changes.
- **what is the value here**: Keeps cached stats up-to-date without server restarts or redundant calculations.
- **Implementation**: Added `fs.watch` to detect changes and refresh the cache.
