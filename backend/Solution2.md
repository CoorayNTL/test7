# Express Application and Middleware Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The updated code improves the API's functionality, modularity, and client accessibility. Key changes include proper route handling for `getCookie`, expanded CORS support, and the addition of centralized error handling, though some issues remain in the error handler implementation.

### Middleware (`errorHandler.js`)

#### 1. Export of `errorHandler` and `logger`
- **Previous**: Only exported `getCookie` and `notFound`, leaving `errorHandler` inaccessible.
- **Updated**: Exports `getCookie`, `notFound`, `errorHandler`, and `logger`.
- **what is the value here**: Enables reuse of `errorHandler` and `logger` across the application, improving modularity.
- **Implementation**: Updated module exports to include all middleware functions.

#### 2. Improved `getCookie` Middleware
- **Previous**: Incorrectly handled Axios responses, only catching errors without sending responses to the client, and was not properly integrated as a route.
- **Updated**: Sends `response.data` as JSON on success and passes errors to `next` for centralized handling.
- **what is the value here**: Ensures clients receive proper responses and errors are handled consistently.
- **Implementation**: Refactored `getCookie` to use `res.json` and `next(err)`.

#### 4. No Changes to `errorHandler` Function
- **Previous & Updated**: Identical `errorHandler` using `Function.constructor` to dynamically create handlers, which is risky and not aligned with Express error-handling middleware.
- **Concern**: The function does not follow the `(err, req, res, next)` signature, limiting its effectiveness.
- **Implementation**: Exported in the updated version but requires refactoring.

### Main Application (`app.js`)

#### 1. CORS Configuration
- **Previous**: Allowed CORS only for `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Updated**: Supports `http://localhost:3000` and `http://192.168.1.3:3000`.
- **what is the value here**: Improves flexibility for frontend access from multiple origins during development/testing.
- **Implementation**: Updated `cors` middleware to allow multiple origins.
